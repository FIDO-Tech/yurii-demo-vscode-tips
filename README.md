# VS Code/Cursor Editor Tips & Tricks Demo

A comprehensive collection of practical editor techniques, shortcuts, and workflow optimizations for VS Code and Cursor users. This project demonstrates essential productivity features that every developer should master.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into 6 focused sections, each covering specific aspects of editor productivity:

### 1. **Multi-Cursor Techniques** (`1-multi-cursor/`)

The most powerful feature in modern editors - learn how to edit multiple lines simultaneously.

- **Alt + Click**: Add/remove cursors at specific positions
- **Ctrl + D**: Select next occurrence of current selection (variable renaming)
- **Command Palette Actions**: Transform text across multiple cursors
- **Shift + Alt + Click**: Add cursors across selections
- **Navigation & Commands**: Home/End navigation with multi-cursor operations

### 2. **Essential Shortcuts** (`2-shortcuts/`)

Master the fundamental keyboard shortcuts that speed up your daily workflow.

- **Basic Commands**: File search, sidebar toggle, explorer, search
- **Window Management**: Split windows, move between panes
- **Commenting**: Toggle single-line and block comments
- **Line Manipulation**: Duplicate lines, expand selections, move lines
- **Symbol Navigation**: Go to symbols in files and workspace

### 3. **Find & Replace with Regex** (`3-find-and-replace/`)

Advanced text manipulation using regular expressions for bulk operations.

- **Icon Import Migration**: Converting SVG imports for build tool changes
- **Testing Framework Migration**: Replacing Jest with Vitest
- **Code Cleanup**: Removing console.logs and other patterns
- **Regex Groups**: Using capture groups for complex replacements

### 4. **Git Integration** (`4-git/`)

Enhanced Git workflow using VS Code's built-in features and extensions.

- **Git Blame**: Track code changes with GitLens
- **File Comparison**: Compare files and commits with better UI
- **Terminal vs GUI**: When to use terminal commands vs GUI tools

### 5. **Customizations** (`5-customizations/`)

Personalize your editor for maximum productivity.

- **Custom Snippets**: Create reusable code templates
- **Settings Optimization**: Font size, minimap, auto-save
- **Essential Extensions**: Project Manager, GitLens, Keep Case
- **Recommended Extensions**: Better Comments, Peacock, Code Screenshot

### 6. **Speedy Workflow** (`6-speedy-workflow/`)

OS-level optimizations and aliases for faster development.

- **Command Aliases**: Shortcuts for common Git commands
- **Cross-Platform Setup**: Windows PowerShell and Unix shell configurations
